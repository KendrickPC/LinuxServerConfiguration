# Webcasts for the Linux Server Configuration Project

Need some additional help getting started with the Linux Server Configuration Project, or simply curious and want to learn a little bit more? Watch the following Webcasts!

These webcasts are recordings of live Q&A sessions and demos. As always, you should read the appropriate rubric for your project thoroughly before you begin work on any project and double check the rubric before submitting. The videos were made by Udacity's coaches. Think of them as extra supplemental materials.
