# Linux Server Configuration

## Project Overview
Take a baseline installation of a Linux server and prepare it to host a web application. 
Secure my server from a number of attack vectors, install and configure a database server, and an existing web application onto my linux server.

## Why this Project?
I want to develop a deep understanding of exactly what my web application is doing, how it is hosted, and the interactions between multiple systems; these are what define a Full Stack Web Developer. 
With this project, I'll be turning a brand-new, bare bones, Linux server into the secure and efficient web application host my application will need.

## What I Learned?
I learned how to access, secure, and perform the initial configuration of a bare-bones Linux server. 
I also learned how to install and configure a web and database server and actually host a web application.

Deploying my web application to a publicly accessible server is the first step in getting users.
Properly securing my application ensures my application remains stable and that my userâ€™s data is safe.
